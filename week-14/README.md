# Week 14: Deploying on Monad
**Phase:** Web3 & Blockchain | **Reward:** 100 TOURS

## Assignment
Deploy your token to Monad testnet and mainnet using Foundry. Verify on MonadScan.

Key rules:
- Always use `--legacy` (Monad uses legacy tx type)
- Use Etherscan v2 API with `?chainid=143` in the URL
- Never use `--chain-id` flag with etherscan verifier
- Keep `.env` out of git

## Deliverable
Create `deployment.md` with testnet + mainnet contract addresses and MonadScan verification links.

## File to submit
